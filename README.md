# Guardian Override — Public Library

Welcome to the **Guardian Override Public Library**.  
This repository contains the complete set of governance annexes, contributor agreements, and enforcement frameworks that define how Guardian Override operates.  

Our goal is to provide **transparent, audit‑ready, and contributor‑friendly documentation** for all community members, founders, and partners.

## 📖 Annex System (v1.0)

Guardian Override organizes its governance and contributor policies into annexes (A–H).  
Each annex is versioned, archived immutably, and cross‑referenced for clarity.
