Guardian Override — Version 1.0  

**Permissive, OSI‑Compatible License**

---

## B.0 Definitions

- **B.0.1 Contributions** — Any work intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Licensed Work, including but not limited to source code, documentation, designs, modifications, or additions, via repositories, communication channels, or other contribution mechanisms.  
- **B.0.2 Licensed Work** — Any Guardian Override project, repository, or distribution to which Contributions are submitted.  
- **B.0.3 Contributor** — Any individual or entity submitting Contributions under this License.  
- **B.0.4 Derivative Works** — Any modifications, adaptations, redistributions, or compilations of the Licensed Work, in source, binary, or documentation form. Derivative Works exclude independent works created without use of Licensed Work materials.  

---

## B.1 License Scope

- **B.1.1 Grant of Rights** — GOOL grants Guardian Override the right to use, modify, and redistribute Contributions, while Contributors retain authorship and recognition.  
- **B.1.2 Binding Agreement** — GOOL is a binding legal agreement between Guardian Override and Contributors. It governs the use, modification, and redistribution of Contributions under the terms herein. This License is incorporated by reference into the Contributor Agreement and subordinate to MEI v1.0 hierarchy, subject to Contributor Agreement enforcement provisions (Annex C §§4–5).  
- **B.1.3 Ownership** — Guardian Override does not claim ownership of Contributions; authors retain copyright.  
- **B.1.4 Founder Protection & Contributor Visibility** — GOOL balances founder‑protective authority with contributor recognition. Contributions remain credited to their authors, even when integrated into Guardian Override systems or redistributed externally.  

---

## B.2 Attribution

- **B.2.1 Attribution Requirements** — Attribution must remain visible, reasonably prominent, and accessible in all derivative works. Acceptable forms include:  
  - Contributor’s real name  
  - Contributor’s pseudonym  
  - Unique contributor identifier (e.g., handle or ID)  

- **B.2.2 Placement** — Attribution must appear in a manner consistent with industry best practices, including:  
  - Source code headers  
  - Documentation files  
  - Credits or acknowledgments sections  

- **B.2.3 Transparency** — Guardian Override may publish attribution summaries to reinforce visibility and recognition. Attribution summaries under GOOL may be referenced in Annex A transparency reports.  

- **B.2.4 Enforcement** — Failure to preserve attribution constitutes a Conduct Violation under Annex C and may trigger enforcement actions. Contributors must remediate attribution issues within 30 days. Permanent suspension requires formal Board resolution and is logged in Appendix MEI.9 for audit traceability.  

---

## B.3 Permissive & OSI‑Compatible

- **B.3.1 Compatibility** — GOOL is fully compatible with permissive open‑source licenses, including MIT, Apache 2.0, and other OSI‑approved licenses.  
- **B.3.2 No Copyleft** — GOOL imposes no copyleft obligations. Redistribution and sublicensing are permitted under permissive terms.  
- **B.3.3 Third‑Party Compliance** — Use of Contributions under GOOL does not waive or alter obligations under other applicable third‑party licenses. Guardian Override may reject or revoke Contributions that fail third‑party compliance, with rationale logged in the Registry. Contributors remain responsible for ensuring compliance. In case of conflict, third‑party license obligations prevail.  
- **B.3.4 Integration** — Contributions under GOOL may be incorporated into copyleft or other projects, provided attribution is preserved. Such incorporation does not impose copyleft obligations on Guardian Override or its contributors. Compatibility ensures seamless integration into the broader open‑source ecosystem.  

---

## B.4 No Removal of Credit

- **B.4.1 Preservation of Attribution** — Derivative works must preserve Contributor attribution.  
- **B.4.2 Prohibition on Obfuscation** — Removal, obfuscation, or substitution of attribution is prohibited, except where legally required.  
- **B.4.3 Encouragement** — Guardian Override encourages clear and consistent credit practices to honor contributor impact.  

---

## B.5 Applicability

- **B.5.1 Internal Use** — Applies to derivative works created inside Guardian Override (internal development and integration).  
- **B.5.2 External Use** — Applies to derivative works created outside Guardian Override, including forks or modifications.  
- **B.5.3 Sublicensing** — Applies to derivative works distributed by third parties under compatible permissive licenses.  
- **B.5.4 Distribution Scope** — Applies to all forms of distribution, including source code, compiled binaries, and documentation. Ensures contributor recognition across all contexts of use.  

---

## B.6 Publication & Updates

- **B.6.2 Accompanying Distribution** — Must accompany all distributed source code, binaries, and documentation.  
- **B.6.3 Updates** — All updates shall be versioned and communicated via repository announcements, mailing lists, or other community channels. Contributors may continue using prior versions under which their Contributions were submitted unless explicitly superseded. Supersession applies prospectively only; prior Contributions remain governed by the version in effect at submission. Supersession requires Board resolution, contributor notification, summary of substantive changes, and logging in Appendix MEI.9 for audit traceability.  
- **B.6.4 Transparency & Commitment** — Publication reinforces Guardian Override’s commitment to open collaboration, contributor recognition, and transparency.  
- **B.6.5 Persistent Cross‑Reference IDs** — References to MEI, Annex C, and other policies use persistent IDs (e.g., ANNEX‑E‑2.1‑2025) for stable citation in reports, audits, and communications.  

---

## B.7 Disclaimer
