# ANNEX H  
**Signature & Consent Log**  
Guardian Override — Version 1.0  

---

## H.0 Purpose & Scope
- **H.0.1** Establishes a standardized, auditable framework for capturing contributor signatures and consent acknowledgments across all Guardian Override agreements, onboarding flows, and operational protocols.  
- **H.0.2** Ensures legal enforceability, version traceability, and investor‑grade transparency.  

---

## H.1 Definitions
- **H.1.1 Signature Event** — A timestamped record of contributor agreement to a specific document version.  
- **H.1.2 Consent Artifact** — Any explicit acknowledgment of terms, protocols, or platform policies.  
- **H.1.3 Log Entry** — A structured data record capturing identity, timestamp, document version, and consent scope.  
- **H.1.4 Audit Trail** — A complete, immutable record of all signature and consent events, maintained for legal and investor review.

## H.2 Signature Protocols
- **H.2.1 Digital Signature** — All contributors must sign agreements via secure, timestamped digital interface.  
- **H.2.2 Version Lock** — Each signature is bound to a specific document version (see Annex D: Publication & Versioning).  
- **H.2.3 Identity Verification** — Contributors must verify identity via platform‑authenticated credentials prior to signature.  
- **H.2.4 Multi‑Signature Support** — Where applicable, co‑signatures (e.g., legal guardians, team leads) are captured and logged.

## H.3 Consent Capture
- **H.3.1 Onboarding Consent** — Contributors must explicitly acknowledge onboarding terms before accessing repositories.  
- **H.3.2 Protocol Consent** — Consent to enforcement, moderation, and publication protocols is captured via tooltip flows and agreement checkboxes.  
- **H.3.3 Update Consent** — For material updates, contributors are prompted to re‑consent to revised terms (see Annex D thresholds).
