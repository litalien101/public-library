## Part A – Binding Legal Terms  

### 0. Contributor Summary  
This summary provides a high‑level overview of the Guardian Override Contributor Agreement.  
It is for clarity only and does not grant rights or modify the binding legal terms.  

#### 0.1 Purpose  
Guardian Override welcomes voluntary contributions of code, design, documentation, research, and community support.  
Contributions help shape the platform’s growth while ensuring founder protection, contributor recognition, and global enforceability.  

Contributions are voluntary and may be accepted, modified, or declined at Guardian Override’s discretion.  

#### 0.2 Key Principles  
- **Voluntary Participation:** Contributions are made freely. No compensation or employment status is created unless a separate signed agreement exists.  
- **Ownership & Licensing:** Contributors retain copyright and authorship. Guardian Override receives a broad license to use, adapt, and distribute Contributions under the Guardian Override Open License (GOOL), a permissive and OSI‑compatible license.  
- **Moral Rights:** Contributors are recognized for their work. Reasonable technical or editorial modifications may be made in good faith.  
- **Patent Protection:** Contributions include a patent license with defensive termination to prevent litigation abuse.  
- **No Partnership:** Submission does not create joint venture, fiduciary, employment, or agency relationships.  

#### 0.3 Recognition Tiers  
- **Early Contributors:** ≥10 accepted contributions in the first 6 months. Permanent symbolic status.  
- **Core Contributors:** ≥25 accepted contributions in any 12‑month period. May be considered for equity or rewards under separate agreements.  
- **Community Contributors:** Occasional contributions recognized publicly.  

> **Note:** Recognition is symbolic and advisory only. It does not imply compensation, employment, or governance authority.  

#### 0.4 Compensation & Incentives  
- Equity or rewards require separate signed agreements.  
- Tokens, if issued, are non‑financial community recognition instruments governed by a separate policy.  
- No expectation of profit, liquidity, or guaranteed compensation.  
- Contributors are responsible for any tax obligations.  

#### 0.5 Governance  
- Leadership retains final authority over all decisions.  
- Contributor governance participation is advisory only.  
- Guardian Override may revise governance structures and will publish changes transparently.  
- Governance participation does not create voting rights or shared control.  

#### 0.6 Dispute Resolution & Enforceability  
- Disputes are resolved first through internal mediation, then arbitration (ICC in Chicago or UNCITRAL in Geneva).  
- Delaware law governs.  
- Consumer rights in EU/UK and other jurisdictions remain protected.  
- Agreement survives mergers, acquisitions, and platform pivots.  

#### 0.7 Contributor Warranties  
Contributors warrant that submissions are original, lawful, safe, and free from infringement, confidential information, or malicious code.  
Contributors must not be restricted by employment agreements or policies that prohibit external contributions.  

#### 0.8 Liability & Privacy  
- Guardian Override’s liability is capped at **USD $500**, any minimum non‑waivable amount required by law, or the amount paid in the past 12 months, whichever is greater.  
- No liability for voluntary contributions, platform changes, or indirect damages.  
- Contributor data may be stored, displayed, and archived in compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy laws.  
- Pseudonyms are supported; data is never sold.  
- International data transfers will follow legally recognized mechanisms (e.g., SCCs, adequacy decisions, or successor frameworks).  

#### 0.9 Entire Agreement  
This summary is explanatory only. The full Contributor Agreement governs all rights and obligations.  
Submission of a Contribution constitutes acceptance of the binding legal terms.
