## A.1 Contributor Definitions

### A.1.1 Early Contributors

- Recognition based on documented contributions and Board approval.  

### A.1.2 Core Contributors
- Individuals making significant, ongoing contributions post‑initial phase.  
- Eligibility determined at Board discretion, based on documented performance metrics and alignment with company goals.  
- All eligibility requires formal documentation and Board approval.  

### A.1.3 Disclaimer on Recognition Classifications
- Classification does not confer ownership, voting rights, or entitlement to future rewards.  
- Recognition is illustrative unless formalized in signed agreements.

## A.2 Equity Allocation

### A.2.1 Early Contributors
- Up to **1% of fully diluted equity** may be allocated collectively.  
- Requires:  
  - Formal Equity Incentive Plan (EIP) approved by the Board.  
  - Individual grant agreements.  
  - Two‑year vesting schedule.  
  - Compliance with securities, tax, and regulatory laws.

### A.2.2 Core Contributors
- Considered for performance‑based equity grants at Board discretion.  
- No guarantee of eligibility.  
- Grants require signed agreement.
